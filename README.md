This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Spotify Clone

This app is clone of the spotify music player and is currently under development.

## Progress

### Day - 1

1. Created a Next app, using [`npx create-next-app`]
2. Added dependencies to the application.
3. Initialized the [`.eslintrc.js`], [`.babelrc`], and [`tsconfig.json`] files.
4. In the [`_app.tsx`], added the root component within the [`<ChakraProvider>`].
5. Updated themes for button component, and grey color using Chakra [`extendedTheme`].
6. Created a git repository, and pushed the code.

### Day - 2

1. Created the Sidebar Layout.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
